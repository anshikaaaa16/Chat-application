# Chat-application
This project includes the features and processes of a Chat Application are for users to communicate with each other in real-time over a network. Typically, such applications are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, enabling seamless communication between individuals or groups.
System 1: System 1 initiates the chat application. Upon launching the application, it waits for incoming connections from other systems on the network. It serves as either the host or the client, depending on the connection setup.
System 2: System 2 also runs the chat application. It connects to System 1, which acts as the host or listens for connections. Once connected, System 2 can send and receive messages to and from System 1.

OBJECTIVES:
CHAT APPLICATION, designed to facilitate communication between two systems within the same network aims to provide a convenient and efficient means of exchanging messages.
❖ Enable users to exchange text messages in real-time, allowing for instant communication.
❖ Implement user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the chat application.
❖ Allow users to manage their contact lists and easily initiate conversations with other users on the network.
